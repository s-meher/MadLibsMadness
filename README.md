## 📚 Overview
Mad Libs Madness is a creative writing game where users fill in different types of words to generate a hilarious personalized letter.  
The project uses form handling, string templates, and dynamic DOM manipulation to create a fun storytelling experience.

---

## 🔨 Built With
- HTML5
- CSS3 (with animated soft cloud background ☁️)
- JavaScript (ES6+)

---

## ✨ Key Features
- **Custom Inputs:** Users input relatives, adjectives, famous people, pets, and more.
- **Generated Story:** A funny story is created dynamically based on user input.
- **Input Validation:** If fields are left empty, placeholders are used instead!
- **Animated Cloud Background:** Soft animated clouds for a dreamy feel.
- **Button Hover Effects:** Buttons scale and color shift for interactivity.
- **Container Animation:** Card "pops" when story is generated.

---

## 🚀 How It Works
- Users fill in the fields for different types of words.
- Clicking **"Generate"** dynamically creates a letter using template literals.
- If any input is empty, the placeholder text (like "Relative") is used instead.
- A cloud background adds a dreamy, magical vibe.
